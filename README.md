This is our hackathon project


Our mission is to create a platform where people who are diagnosed with mental health illness or have drug addiction can meet each other to make each individual feel less alone about their situation. Our project aim is to generate several groups with experts and mental health illness people, providing them with online activities and "lessons" on the topic of drugs and addiction from which experts can help educate people with mental health issues to help cope with their situation by keeping them connected, accepting and helping them make right choices.
